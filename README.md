The objectives of this project include:

1. Conducting basic statistical analysis and testing for the normality of age distribution.
2. Analyzing the impact of cholesterol and glucose levels on age using categorical variables.
3. Performing non-parametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) to identify significant differences between groups based on cholesterol and glucose categories.
5. Performing correlation analysis to determine statistical relationships between different factors (age, weight, glucose level, etc.) and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
6. Visualizing data using box plots, bar graphs, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.

P.S. it is advisable to open this project in the collab because the correlation matrix  is not displayed in github
